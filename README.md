pyside-chaco-template
=====================

A simple PySide GUI application template that embeds  traited UI and Mayavi, matplotlib etc. as starting point. 
A few snippets strung together for my reference.

To test:

* Install Enthought Canopy Python Distribution
* go to chaco-in-pyside/test and execute "test-chaco-in-pyside" script.
